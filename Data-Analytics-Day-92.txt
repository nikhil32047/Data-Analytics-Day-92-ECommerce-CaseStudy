E-Commerce Analytics Case Study

Focus: Customer Purchase Behavior, Product Recommendations, Sales Forecasting

🔹 Lesson 1: Understanding E-Commerce Data
=============================================
Summary:
E-commerce platforms collect massive data — customer demographics, browsing history, purchases, reviews, and returns. Understanding this data structure is key.
Key Tables:
--------------
customers → demographics
orders → order details
products → catalog info
transactions → payment history

Example:
An e-commerce dataset might show:

Customer_ID	Product	Category	Price	Quantity	Date
1001	iPhone 15	Electronics	79999	1	2024-06-12

Goal: Analyze which customers buy which products and why.

🔹 Lesson 2: Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis
======================================================
Summary:
Helps identify loyal customers and purchase patterns.
Use RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis
Group customers by purchase behavior
Calculate CLV (Customer Lifetime Value)

Example:
Customers who made a purchase in the last 30 days and spend ₹10,000+ are tagged as “High-Value Customers”.

🔹 Lesson 3: Product Recommendation Systems
=================================================
Summary:
Recommendation systems increase user engagement and sales.
Collaborative Filtering → recommends based on similar users
Content-Based Filtering → recommends similar products
Hybrid Models → combines both

Example:
If a user buys “MacBook Air”, recommend “MacBook Case” or “USB-C Adapter”.

🔹 Lesson 4: Sales Forecasting with Time Series
=====================================================
Summary:
Predicting future sales helps in inventory and marketing decisions.
Use moving averages and seasonal decomposition
Apply ARIMA, Prophet, or LSTM models for forecasts

Example:
Amazon forecasts a 20% spike in electronics sales every festive season based on past data trends.

🔹 Lesson 5: Case Study – Building an E-Commerce Analytics Dashboard
=====================================================================
Summary:
Combine all lessons into one dashboard:
Clean customer and order data
Segment customers (RFM)
Visualize top products, repeat buyers, sales trend
Forecast next month’s sales

Example:
A Power BI dashboard shows:
📈 Top 10 Products by Revenue
🛍️ High-Value Customers by Region
💸 Next Month Sales Forecast
